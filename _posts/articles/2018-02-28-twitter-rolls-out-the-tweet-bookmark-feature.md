<h2>Feature requested by community</h2>

This feature was long time ago requested by several people to make Twitter better and now we finally got it. The new feature means that you’ll no longer have to rely on makeshift storage methods for saving tweets, such as DM'ing them to yourself or clicking the little heart icon so the posts stay put in your “Likes” feed.

<h2>My Comment</h2>

The function is useful without any doubt and it's now here, hopefully Twitter will listen more often to their own community and supporters o make the platform better.
