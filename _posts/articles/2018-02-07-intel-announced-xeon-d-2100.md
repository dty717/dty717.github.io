After all the leaks and negative press, Intel seems to not give any shit - today <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/xeon/d-2100-brief.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel has announced a new processor the Xeon D-2100</a>. The D-2100 is a <em>low power</em> SoC with a range of 4 to 18 cores, integrated PCH, up to 4 10Gb Ethernet ports, and a TDP of 60-110 watts. The new processor features a significant performance increase over the old D-1500 (Broadwell-DE).

<h2>Higher TDP's and ... a higher price</h2>

The "new" CPU (still 14nm btw37,5 × 37,5 mm) will use a TDP 60 up to 110W. At this time it's unclear if there are Low-Power-Variants planned or not, at least I got no information on this but it could be possible.

The 16 core CPU will be around 1800 USD, this is a lot of more than the older D-1500, which was around 1200 USD.

AMD will also release a 16 core CPU, Snowy Owl alias AMD Epyc Embedded are expected at the end of this month.
