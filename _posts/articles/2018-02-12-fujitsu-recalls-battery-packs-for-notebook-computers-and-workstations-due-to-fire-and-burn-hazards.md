<h2>Final Words</h2>

It's really beyond me why this still can happen, this is a known issue, I guess it started with Samsung batteries and washing machines which overheated and even sometimes exploded - This is now a years old story and that the cause of this was already identified is also known, it has something to do with the materials within the batteries and all of this isn't new, however, I think that the manufacturers want to save money on the wrong end and batteries are definitely to the wrong end because it can be dangerous.
