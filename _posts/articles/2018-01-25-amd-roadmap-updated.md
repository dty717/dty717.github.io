I'm skeptical that we see new CPU's after 2022, cause there already huge problems with 5nm (first basic transistors worked with 5nm) but after that nothing is planed because the physical limits we reach here.

The biggest change will be the efficiency and the smaller DIE, the architecture are <em>only tweaked</em> from generation to generation, why AMD and Intel are doing it is beyond me, they could release 'the best architecture' already but then they might sell less chips.

Zen 3 might be my next update and then I will use it for longer until we know what is coming in the future with a roadmap which explains how they solve the &lt;5nm problem.
