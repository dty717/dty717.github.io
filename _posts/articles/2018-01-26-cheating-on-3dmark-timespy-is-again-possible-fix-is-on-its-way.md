Ronaldo Buassali found a way to cheat on 3DMark TimeSpy, he uses <a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/nvidia-inspector-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nVidia Inspector</a> to do this.

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<ol>
    <li>You start the 3DMark TimeSpy benchmark - then you need to wait a while before the benchmark actually runs like 10-20 seconds.</li>
    <li>In this time before the benchmark runs you can open nVidia Inspector and manipulate the image quality settings.</li>
    <li>This simple trick makes it possible to gain a better/higher score.</li>
</ol>

Ronaldo Buassali made a video demonstrating the procedure and effect, he gains a normal total score of 12638 and graphics score of 13278 in Time Spy. By applying the changed image quality settings he increased his score to 12951 / 13800. Software from Futuremark’s, Unigine’s and Allbenchmark’s benchmarks seems to be affected too.

Right now there is there is a statement from GALAX that this gets fixed - but one thing is crystal clear- it shows again people which want to cheat will always find a way to bypass even professional programs.

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">As this method has now been made public it is probable that no scores will be accepted into the Halls of Fame until the new version with the fix is released.</span></p>
