<strong>Release date
</strong>Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus will launch at on 25 March MWC will be in February.

<strong>Price
</strong>According to reports, the Galaxy S9 will be £100 more expensive than last year's S8, with pricing set to start at £789. By the same logic, expect the Galaxy S9+ to start from £879 SIM-free.

The phone looks really good, I'm not a fan of such a huge screen but it's matter of taste, I like that there is a headphone jack and that it still has a FM radio, Titanium Grey looks really hot and I really consider to replace my S5 mini.
