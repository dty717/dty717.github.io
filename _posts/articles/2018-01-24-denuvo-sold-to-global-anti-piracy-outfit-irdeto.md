In contrast, Irdetoâ€™s roots go all the way back to 1969 and currently has almost 1,000 staff. Depending on what Irdeto decides to do with Denuvo technology, the added resources could definitely advance it quickly.

Tough to say what happens with this, but I would have to imagine it won't be anything good for the consumer buying the game. I am not a fan of Denuvo and the thought of it becoming even bigger and hairier isn't something I'm looking forward to.

<blockquote>"The success of any game title is dependent upon the ability of the title to operate as the publisher intended," said Doug Lowther, CEO, Irdeto. "As a result, protection of both the game itself and the gaming experience for end users is critical. Our partnership brings together decades of security expertise under one roof to better address new and evolving security threats."</blockquote>

Who knows, perhaps Irdeto can make it more effective and less intrusive. The biggest problem with copyright protection still seems that you need an online connection all the time and that it might have an impact on your system performance, that are big cliffhanger on the other side I can understand that publisher want to protect their products but imho that should't be done on the back of their customers, especially because we see with each release that it gets cracked anyway.
