<h2>Changing the Power Plan according to your needs</h2>

All Windows PC's no matter if Windows 7, 8 or 10. offering by default three power plans, and they each have different settings for when the computer sleeps. The three plans are <strong>Power Saver</strong>, <strong>Balanced</strong>, and <strong>High Performance</strong>. One way to quickly change Sleep settings it to choose one of these plans.

The <strong>Power Saver</strong> plan will take your PC much faster into a sleep state since the timer for it is set to , which is a great option for laptop users who want to get the most out of their battery or those simply trying to save electricity.

<strong>Balanced</strong> is the default and is often the best option for general users, as it is neither too restrictive or too limiting.

<strong>High Performance</strong> leaves the computer active the longest before it goes to sleep. This setting will result in the battery draining more quickly if left as the default.

To select a new Power Plan and apply its default Sleep settings:

<ul>
    <li><b>Open the Control Panel.</b></li>
    <li><strong>Select</strong> <strong>Power Options</strong> like you see in the screeshots.</li>
    <li>In the resulting window, <strong>click</strong> the <strong>arrow</strong> by <strong>Show Additional Plans</strong> to see the High Performance option. This profile is designed for Gaming and in case you like all available PC resources for eg. crypto mining.</li>
    <li>To see the default settings for any plan, <strong>click</strong> <strong>Change Plan Settings</strong> next to the <strong>Power Plan </strong>you are considering. Then, <strong>click</strong> <strong>Cancel</strong> to return to the Power Options window. Repeat as desired.</li>
    <li><strong>Select</strong> your <strong>Power Plan</strong> and then apply the changes. All changes are immediately done so you won't need to restart your PC.</li>
</ul>

This method works on Windows 7 up to Windows 10 the same way.

<h2>Windows 10 (only)</h2>

To change sleep settings on a Windows 10 machine, try this:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Click</strong> the <strong>Start button</strong> in the bottom left corner of the screen.</li>
    <li><strong>Type</strong> <strong>Sleep</strong> and <strong>select</strong> <strong>Power &amp; Sleep Settings</strong>, which will likely be the first option.</li>
    <li><strong>Click</strong> the <strong>arrow</strong> by the <strong>drop-down</strong> lists to configure the settings exactly as you want.</li>
    <li><strong>Click</strong> the <strong>X</strong> in the top right corner of this window to close it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="heading">Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 (only)</h2>

<img class="  wp-image-3844 aligncenter" src="https://chefkochblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/windows-8-sleep.png" alt="Windows 8 sleep" width="200" height="255" />

<ul>
    <li><strong>Type</strong> <strong>Sleep</strong> in the Search.</li>
    <li>In the results <strong>select</strong> <strong>Power and sleep settings</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Select</strong> the desired <strong>options</strong> from the resulting lists to apply them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Windows 7 (only)</h2>

<img class=" size-full wp-image-3845 aligncenter" src="https://chefkochblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/windows-7-power-plan.png" alt="Windows 7 Power Plan" width="609" height="485" />

Windows 7 doesn't offer an UWP Settings Menu like in Windows 8/8.1 or 10 so you have to go trough this via the Control Panel.

<ul>
    <li><strong>Click</strong> the <strong>Power Options</strong> icon or alternative navigate to the <strong>control panel</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Select</strong> the desired <strong>Power Plan</strong> and then click <strong>Change Plan Settings</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Use</strong> the ​lists to apply the desired settings and click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Close</strong> Control Panel by clicking the <strong>X</strong> in the top right corner of the window.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Closing Words</h2>

Controlling the Power Plan is important and you should not underestimate it, energy costs are climbing higher and higher and there is no need to waste energy if you're PC is in a IDLE state (the time the PC is on but nothing happens).

Working with the giving options is really easy and advance users can checkout additional options by clicking the 'Change plan settings' button but since those is optional and for each user a different decision I not explicit mentioned it but it's worth to be checked.
