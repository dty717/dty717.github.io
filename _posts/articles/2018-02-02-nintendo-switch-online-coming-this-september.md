<span id="intelliTXT">Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/online-service/" rel="noopener">announced </a>that Nintendo Switch Online will be released this September (2018). You will have to use the Switch Online app for Android and iOS, which will integrate with games to show stats and more, and will also be required for partying with friends and voice communication. The service will cost $3.99 a month, $7.99 for 3 months, or $19.99 a year. You will also get the Classic Game Selection, where Subscribers will get to download a compilation of classic titles with added online play, such as Super Mario Bros. 3, Balloon Fight and Dr. Mario.</span>

I wonder how popular this service will be due to the general clumsiness of having to use a smartphone for nearly everything. I imagine the "Classic Game Selection" being a part of the subscription will be it's biggest selling point.

<blockquote>This paid service lets Nintendo Switch owners enjoy online multiplayer gaming as well as a dedicated smartphone app that connects to your Nintendo Switch system and helps you connect with friends for online play sessions in compatible games.</blockquote>

<h3>Open questions</h3>

<ul>
    <li>What happens with the free content when the 'paid stuff' arrives?</li>
    <li>Is there any balance between paid and free or is it yet again a pay to win concept?</li>
    <li>Are offline games possible or requires the game to be connected let's say every 10 minutes or even worse all the time?</li>
</ul>
