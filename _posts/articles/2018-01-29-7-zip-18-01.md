<h2>Overview</h2>

The new beta version of the archiving software comes with support for unpacking .obj and .coff files. The rest of the changes are more related to advance users. Normal daily users will notice that the multi-threading compression performance of LZMA2 archives such as xz and 7z got improved in the release, 7-Zip uses additional buffers for multi-block LZMA2 compression, and CPU utilization improved slightly as a consequence.

<h2>Changelog</h2>

As always the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/discussion/45797/thread/c89dff27/?limit=25#4d4e">changelog can be found in the official forum</a>.

    <li>Some bugs were fixed. 7-Zip could crash in some cases.</li>
    <li>7-Zip now can unpack DMG archives that use LZFSE compression method.</li>

<h2>Final words</h2>
7-Zip is a fantastic alternative to Winrar and does its job, sadly the development is a little bit slow for my taste but it's not like that some voodoo or magic gets integrated with each new major release so it's not that dramatically, no matter if you use the beta or final version, it does its job and more importantly it's open source.

The <a href="https://landave.io/2018/01/7-zip-multiple-memory-corruptions-via-rar-and-zip">security related issues</a> seems fixed and I'm excited what's coming next.
