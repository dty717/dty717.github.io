<h2>Final words</h2>

I'm more the MPC-BE guy but VLC is still a good solution and works for all the videos and formats out there, as always it's a matter of taste and what you really need - so decide well and have fun with the new release. I think an important step was made by integrating HDR among other decoder related changes because high quality material is on the rise and this requires a more efficient player/decoding.

VLC does it's job very well and each release gets better and better. An interface for madVR would be perfect but maybe this is already on a todo list. Besides such 'first world' problems there is nothing you really miss in the new version .
