<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Microsoft was reacting quickly in order to solve the issue, of course it should't happen in the first place but it did and the workaround might help those people who are affected.

Maybe instead of messing with Office which is <em>becoming the Adobe Flash replacement</em> - how about installing LibeOffice? Less Office less cluster-fuck. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3536" src="https://chefkochblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/leme01z.gif" alt="lEMe01Z" width="27" height="24" />
