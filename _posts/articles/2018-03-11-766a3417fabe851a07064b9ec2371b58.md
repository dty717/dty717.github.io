I've been reading through your list of Windows 10 Privacy Tools, and I'm wondering what your choice is for personal use?

It seems that a good program would be updated frequently, and would have the ability to keep step with, accommodate, or at least alert to those Windows Updates that add intrusive features, or disable the privacy settings already configured.

Great and useful site.  Thanks.

Adam
