Apple was busy today, the update for macOS High Sierra <a href="https://support.apple.com/de-de/HT208465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fixes several security holes</a>,Â iOS also fixes some possible <a href="https://support.apple.com/de-de/HT208463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holes</a>. Both updates are only bugfix releases, there is no new option added related to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-iphone-battery-slow-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently battery scandal</a>. Apple promised to introduce a new option for this, but we got nothing (yet).

I did some research on the official Apple pages and there is nothing mentioned from Meltdown &amp; Spectre which is strange because I expect from a bugfix release that it at least mention something about the biggest hardware hole ever.

<h2>iOS 11.2.5</h2>
