<h3>Interesting to know</h3>

You can 'over-install' the update over the previews released preview without any problem. The installation process detects automatically which programs needs to be closed in order to upgrade your .NET Framework version, so you can choose to automatically closing them or do it manually.

After you installed the update you need to restart your PC.

<h2>Closing Words</h2>

I'm not really involved in NET Framework things but the changelog looks promising, the color fixes are something which every user can profit from and the rest of the changes also are interesting for developers. Hopefully we're going to see a final version soon because .NET Framework made a big step forward since it was open sourced.
