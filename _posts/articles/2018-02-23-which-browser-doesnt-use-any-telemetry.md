People might wonder these days which Browser doesn't collect any private data and the result is just horrible.

<h2>Which Browsers are privacy-focused?</h2>

In short none, every Browser has huge weaknesses no matter if you use Firefox based Browser which need to be 'tweaked' via user.js configuration files or Chrome Browser which needsÂ chrome://flags changes. Basically, there is only Chrome and Firefox on the market, other engines have such a small user base that they don't matter.

Internet Explorer seems the only Browser which doesn't collect any data all other Browsers collect encrypted or non-encrypted data to improve the product.
