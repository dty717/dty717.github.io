Google is banning all online ads promoting cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings starting June 2018. In their <a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/7648803?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=29265" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a>Â it's said that the financial policy will receive an update in order to ban ads for all cryptocurrency wallets and trading advice.

<h2>What does the change mean?</h2>

That means that even companies with legitimate cryptocurrency offerings won't be allowed to serve ads through any of Google's ad products, which place advertising on its own sites as well as third-party websites.

Google said it took down more than 3.2 billion ads last year (2017) that violated its policies, which is nearly double the 1.7 billion it removed in 2016. The full stats can be viewed in their <a href="https://blog.google/topics/ads/advertising-ecosystem-works-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bad ads report</a>.

<h2>Closing Words</h2>

Good decision and it hopefully reduces the amount of possible attacks. Hopefully other provider will follow Google's decision here. Facebook seems to already started <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/73030-facebook-banning-ads-promoting-questionable-financial-products-including.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doing the same</a> with the difference that there not really blocking every cryptocurrencie related promotions.

It's always a shame that every new technology gets abused and that only the government or bigger providers need to take action until something changes. Because greedy people always trying to quickly making money.

Some people might now say Google wants once again control the ads market but that's not entirely correct because Google itself could had released their own 'crypto' ads service but that is not the case here, maybe they just realized that the crypto thing is not worth to be supported? I mean high energy costs, more traffic, possible attacks to steal mining power from others are only some odd to mention here.
