And another news today from Qualcomm, their latest Snapdragon 845 VR package is able to show a resolution of 1024 x 1152 with incredible 120 FPS (per eye/display), which would be more than enough for really every game on the market right now in decent FPS without getting the motion sickness on faster scenes eg. in roller coaster simulators. The HTC Vive Pro packs a higher-res 1400x1600 per eye display, but only at 90Hz, which means that Qualcomm is clearly the winner in the VR battle.

<h2>Specifications</h2>

Snapdragon 845 packs an 8-core Kryo 385 CPU powered by Adreno 630 graphics, dedicated Hexagon digital signal processor (DSP) and a Spectra 280 image signal processors (ISP) it also supports 3D audio support. The pixel quality seems to be at 4 billion pixels per eye which is really decent.

There was no price given at this point but I'm sure we will see and hear more very soon.

<h2>Final Words</h2>

Two good Qualcomm news on one day, I'm official impressed and it seems they're putting a lot of effort, a lot tech and FPS in their latest VR package to provide something which even satisfies hardcore gamer and enthusiasts. I like the package, let's hope it is not too expensive but the time will tell us more.
