<h2>Detailed Overview</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Custom wallpapers</strong> – Drop your image of choice into a folder called “IMAGES” on a USB stick, then apply them under Settings &gt; Themes on your PS4.</li>

    <li><strong>PSVR Support Icon</strong> – A little icon will tell you if the game supports PSVR or not.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Backwards compatibility is the only area where Microsoft is ahead of Sony and this wasn't changed in this update. But the good thing is that this updates makes a positive step forward in the rest of the mentioned features - The library improvements alone make the update worth it for me and it's always good to see a big update with lots of new features because that makes the update(s) interesting.

<p style="text-align:center;">Happy gaming!</p>
