I suck at Adobe Photoshop - I really do, maybe because my interest in such things are not existent or maybe because I never seriously did an online course - but sometimes I like to remove the background of an Image and Windows/Linux integrated programs doesn't have such function. So what to do then? Install just for it an extra program? Well, you could do it with a portable program but why? There are online solutions which are good enough for this.

<h2>Not every online solution is good</h2>

Some services are really bad, I won't call them out there but they want money, or even a monthly subscription to remove the background. The worst service I found said that they use your created picture to sell it, which is really a no go.

I found out that <a href="http://online.photoscissors.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online.photoscissors.com</a> works quite good and it's free. Even I as beginner had no troubles using the program.

<h2>Upload, Edit and Download</h2>

The left side is your original picture which you uploaded, I did this with a test meme picture. The right side shows the result. Looks good enough to me and my needs.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">Please keep in mind that you should not upload 'private' picture in any cloud due security reasons - you simply never know what the provider does with your pictures</span></span>.

The result was for the first try not bad, the service worked I even tested it in several other Browsers and I can say there wasn't any problem with the service.

<h2>Final Words</h2>

No one is an expert in every program and I searched for an online solution for my 'background removal' problem without the need to install or download yet another program just for one or two pictures. <a href="http://online.photoscissors.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online.photoscissors.com</a> seems to be good enough for beginners to remove the background in easy steps.
