<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/spotify-emails-warning-to-pirates-using-hacked-apps-180305/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TorrentFreak</a> reports that Spotify users which using 'hacked apps' getting a warning eMail which tells you that "abnormal activity" has been observed from the user's software and if you don't stop it your account might get banned. I wonder how Spotify will do this especially if you can simply re-create another fake account?!

<h2>Modded Spotify Apps</h2>

Spotify hasn't done anything against these hacked apps yet and you even get all the premium functions without paying anything. An <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Accounts/Abnormal-activity-in-my-account-what-is-it/td-p/4406021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user in the official Spotify forum</a> reporting this message so it seems that Spotify at least now 'detect' modified Spotify clients. At this point it's unclear when Spotify takes real action here except to warn people to uninstall the client.

<blockquote>We detected abnormal activity on the app you are using so we have disabled it. Don’t worry – your Spotify account is safe.

To access your Spotify account, simply uninstall any unauthorized or modified version of Spotify and download and install the Spotify app from the official Google Play Store. If you need more help, please see our support article on Reinstalling Spotify.

<h2>Spotify Dogfood mod removed from GitHub</h2>

The most popular 'mod' was Dogfood but it was banned due a <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2018/2018-03-01-Spotify.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DMCA request</a>.

Dogfood's mod was able to use Spotify with a freemium account ads-free and without any limitation like quality restrictions or interrupts while playing a full playlist.

<h2>Music is not available all over the world as main excuse</h2>

Most pirates using the 'my music is not available in country xyz' argument to excuse that they pirate the music. I think Spotify isn't to blame here if the original Author decided to not publish their music in let's say USA. In my opinion it's well justified since Spotify actually gives what it advertises and that's fair enough.

<h3>DRM</h3>

I think the real and better argumentation is DRM restrictions which forces you to install Spotify or other clients on your devices in order to listening to the music because the Songs can't be downloaded (free users) or are because of the restrictions encrypted.

Some providers, eg. Netflix won't allow you to use your VPN and that's also some kind of restriction, not DRM based but 'geo-blocking' and that are reasons for me to stay away from such things (if possible).

<h2>Free and legal alternatives?</h2>

<a href="http://www.s2music.com/popular-genres" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S2Music</a> is one free and legal alternative. Their database is not as big as Spotify (not really a surprise) but it's legal and you get music for free without any problems or the need to install a client to listening to it.

Another page is <a href="http://myzuka.club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myzuka</a>, it's a russian page but it should be no problem to navigate trough the page since the important things are in english (or just hover over the links and see the english description in the link url).

<a href="http://convert2mp3.net/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, there <a href="https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/mp3-converter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bunch off tools</a> our there to download/convert or rip the music out of the video. it's not really 'legal' more like a grey-zone because the platform which provide such function is responsable for this (and of course you).

<h2>Final Words</h2>

Spotify is trying to gentle knocking off users with 'fake'/'modded'/'hacked' clients which is their right but they might should check why people pirating their services and fix that instead which would be the better solution for everyone in my opinion.

I like that Spotify slowly take action here because it gives pirate time to find new strategies and as long Spotify not re-thinks about their license model nothing ever will be changed.
