<a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/52.6.0/win32/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mozilla just released another final</a> version of it's Thunderbird version, 52.6.0 comes with minor changes and corrections. At this time I wrote the article, Mozilla still links to the older 52.5.2 version.

The releasenotes can be found <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/52.6.0/releasenotes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> together with the system requirements <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/52.0/system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

The latest 58 beta can be found <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/58.0b3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> - releasenotes <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/58.0beta/releasenotes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

<h2>What's new</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Searching message bodies of messages in local folders, including filter and quick filter operations, not working reliably: Content not found in base64-encode message parts, non-ASCII text not found and false positives found.</li>
    <li>Defective messages (without at least one expected header) not shown in IMAP folders but shown on mobile devices</li>
    <li>Calendar: Unintended task deletion if numlock is enabled</li>
    <li>Various <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/known-vulnerabilities/thunderbird/#thunderbird52.6">security fixes</a></li>
</ul>

It's a pure bugfix version as you can see from the releasenotes but I'm thankfully that these guys working on the <em>best eMail client ever</em>! Mozilla v58.x is almost done and people getting the new "Photon" UI very soon as default new look.
