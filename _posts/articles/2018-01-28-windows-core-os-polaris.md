Microsoft is working and working, the new Codename Polaris represents a new 'modern' Windows which removed some old crap. The upper layer is Windows S which means at the end of 2019 the OS will replace Windows 10 Home &amp; Windows S. An upgrade to a Pro version will not be possible.

The main idea is to make Windows 10 truly universal and more adaptable to the environment it’ll run on that being on a wearable or IoT device, tablet, laptop, desktop, and other types of devices.

<h2>Polaris</h2>

The OS is designed for low-end devices which in theory can attack Google Chrome OS or iOS. Android is simply too powerful. One thing to note is that Windows Core OS (WCOS) is not something that customers can use, as mentioned, it's designed for low-end devices.

<h2>Structure</h2>

<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/understanding-windows-core-os-and-polaris" rel="noopener">The WindowsCentral post</a> also points out that Microsoft is likely to bring WCOS-based OS to the public in 2018. Microsoft will not bring WCOS directly to Windows laptops and desktops. Instead, WCOS will make its debut in the form of mobile devices.

This will make it much easier and flexible for OEMs as they will no longer need to deal with different Windows variants like Windows 10 Home, Windows 10 S, Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Mobile, Windows Server and Windows 10 IoT including many others.  It is meant to be an internal platform to make Windows more flexible and light-weight.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

This will help OEMs and eliminate some version confusions - I think it could help, but I have huge doubts that this really competes against iOS or Google Chrome OS. The Windows phone OS is practical dead and Windows simply was too late to get into the mobile market, they try now to fix their own mess but it seems way too late.
