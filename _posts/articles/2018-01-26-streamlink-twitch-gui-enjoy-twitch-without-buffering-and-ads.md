Streamlink Twitch GUI is an alternative way to browse Twitch without any Browser, you get a minimalistic interface which brings back the focus - on the streamer and not on Twitch which is more and more only focused how to get more money out of their streamers which doing the real work.

That said advertisements are okay but they shouldn't annoy you or ending in buffering, this is why you should consider to give this program a try. Sadly Twitch integrates more and more gimmicks which disturbs the users, which only want to see the streams and not the latest Amazon Alexa announcement.

</ol>

<h2>Final words</h2>

If you have everything setup correctly and gave the program the path to the video player you can click on a stream and it should open it into a new video window. That's basically it you can now watch Twitch without garbage, the pure stream without any annoying buffering or other garbage.

The program can be trusted, it's open source and maintained by a lot of people, a neat feature is that you can enjoy your stream without been disturbed by advertisements.

Twitch is going more and more to shit after they integrated stuff like cheers and other crap which doesn't help the streamer, moreover to help Twitch to get more and more money - the page buffers and is slow because Twitch adds tons of 3rd-party domains to their pages to deliver amazon ads and trying to track every move your made - this is the reason I say stop and which made me switch to programs like Streamlink Twitch GUI.

The program is a <em>must</em> if you often watch Twitch streams andÂ  if you only want to watch your favourite streamer.
