Microsoft has now confirmed that no new Mobile builds are coming to Insiders.

Microsoft has today confirmed that <a href="https://twitter.com/brandonleblanc/status/956234868203036672" rel="external nofollow noopener">"no Mobile builds are coming"</a> to Insiders who are still using Windows 10 Mobile and holding out for some kind of love from Microsoft. The company did originally state that more Mobile builds would be coming, but when asked if this was still happening, Jason Howard, senior program manager on the Windows Insider Team, <a href="https://twitter.com/NorthFaceHiker/status/956575200664932352" rel="external nofollow noopener">said "Plans change. Such is the nature of things."</a>

<h2>What about to UWP apps?</h2>

UWP apps continue to receive updates! For now, at least, most UWP apps are still targeting Windows 10 Mobile, which means apps should continue to work just fine. This won't last forever, though, so be prepared for the eventual abandonment of Windows 10 Mobile altogether.

The change makes sense because Microsoft wants to use push their own Windows Core Edition to customers.
