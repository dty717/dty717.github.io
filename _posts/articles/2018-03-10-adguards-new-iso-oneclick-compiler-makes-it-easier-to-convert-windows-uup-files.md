<h2>New OneClick ISO compiler</h2>

Before AdGuard released a new OneClick ISO compiler solution people had to manually download a little program to decrypt the UUP (Unified Update Platform) file, this has now changed so you're select which UUP / Windows Build you want, download it and the integrated 'creatingISO.cmd' automatically converts Windows to the ISO file, which can be burned or extracted to a USB drive to install Microsoft Windows OS.

Clicking the 'creatingISO.cmd' file will open a command prompt window which shows the converting process. The converting process is now a lot of easier because you don't have to search for the correct converter tool anymore, all you need is integrated within one single download.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Good move and it gets now easier for you to download the latest Build, all what you need is integrated and you won't need to spent your time on searching for the correct converter utility anymore.
