<h2>Program Overview</h2>

Patch My PC was founded in <a href="https://patchmypc.net/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2011 by Justin Chalfant</a>. Their official website shows 7 people involved in this product for PR, Testing and the program code. The program itself is freeware and can be used for Windows 7 up to Windows 10. The company provides a full documentation including a FAQ which you can see <a href="https://patchmypc.net/patch-my-pc-updater-documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The <a href="https://patchmypc.net/forum/index.php?action=register" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official forum</a> offers support and in case something is missing you could do a bug report or feature request right over there.

There is also a special version for Windows XP, the normal version doesn't support XP anymore, this legacy version can be downloaded <a href="https://patchmypc.net/freeupdater/PatchMyPCLegacySupport.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

<h2>Using Patch My PC</h2>

Unless other applications you can download the updates trough Patch My PC directly which basically downloads the update from their servers. The program by itself checks for latest program updates (or on a manually set schedule).

<img class=" size-full wp-image-3817 aligncenter" src="https://chefkochblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/patchmypc-settings-export.png" alt="PatchMyPC-Settings-Export" width="1010" height="593" />

The program is very easy to use, the user interface is a matter of taste and the good thing is that the program has the ability to export it's settings, the PatchMyPC.ini will be exported to the same location as the program executable - which is useful in case you have multiple systems, so make your changes - export it and then copy &amp; paste the PatchMyPC.ini into the same dir as the PatchMyPC.exe.

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

The program is small in size it's around 1.65 MB (similar like SUMo). It requires Internet access (no shit!) and .NET Framework which should be pre-installed in Windows so you don't have to be worried it will work straight after the installation.

<h2>Comparison with SUMo</h2>

SUMo needs a Pro version in order to update your products (which opens a link to the official page) while Patch My PC actually really update your apps with one click, it downloads the update manually (or automatically) from the severs. This is not possible with SUMo because license/privacy policy reasons and that's the reason why SUMo's database is bigger compared to Patch My PC which 'only' supports 300+ apps.

The export settings mechanism is also missing in SUMo (well you could manually export and import %appdata%\KC Softwares\SUMo but it's not as comfortable as with Patch My PC which offers a handy .ini file to store its settings.

SUMo also lacks of the ability to schedule update checks and this is really a nice function to have, from what I know this is planned in future SUMo versions.

<h2>Final Words</h2>

Patch My PC is really a nice little application, it's really good to have, sadly the database is due license/privacy policy reasons not as big as it should be, but the developers are not to blame here, the original installed application simply must explicit allow this. The program is a real alternative to SUMo if your applications are supported by Patch My PC. Theoretically you won't need such software at all but it can make you life a little bit easier, especially if you have a lot of applications installed you might give SUMo or Patch My PC a try to stay up2date.

Patch My PC offers a freeware program which supports bulk downloads and installations which is really nice, among with the export feature and the schedule feature it could help admins to keep an eye on their software.

I haven't found any hidden ads annoying offers or other things within the program and that's also a reason why I can recommend the program. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3539" src="https://chefkochblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/lol10.gif" alt="lol10" width="38" height="20" />
