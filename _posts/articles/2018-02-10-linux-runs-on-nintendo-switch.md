The well known Hacker group fail0verflow has gotten Linux to run on the Nintendo Switch. According to a report from TechCruch, fail0verflow says there is a flaw in the boot ROM of Nvidia's Tegra X1 SoC. I already explained how this works, but in short: WHen the console boots, it executes some code in the ROM with instructions about the boot process. The boot ROM is stored within the Tegra X1 SoC, so without Nvidia manufacturing chips that change this, a standard software update wouldn't patch this.

If fail0verflow decides to share the exploit, it could open up many possibilities when it comes to homebrew software and of course pirated games. It could have some financial implications for Nintendo in positive or negative ways.

This is the first time that we see a running Linux version on this device and the hopes are very high from the community that we might get a 'ready-to-go' product this year. This yet again shows nothing is impossible and with enough effort and passion, you can reach your goals.
