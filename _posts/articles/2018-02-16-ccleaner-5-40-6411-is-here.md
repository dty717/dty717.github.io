<h2>Download</h2>

I provide all the available links because the official homepage is confusing and doesn't show all links on one page. As always, a product matrix can be found <a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/business/ccleaner-product-matrix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> which shows what are the differences between each versions.

The links never change except the versions numbers so you can bookmark them to update the product, I still suggest to block the executable and the updater with your firewall and only download it through the official download links. This is btw my recommendation for all software products not only CCleaner, just review each download manually, before you download and install them, just to ensure nothing gets into your systems.

<h2>Final Words</h2>

The CCleaner team is working hard to improve the product and it gets smaller fixes faster than before, this is a good sign - I mean after the data leak disaster these guys really need to fight for their reputation but there is no alternative to such powerful little utility available and it still does it job very well. The new update is more a bugfix and cosmetical update but even this might help to avoid possible troubles especially for none technically people out there.
