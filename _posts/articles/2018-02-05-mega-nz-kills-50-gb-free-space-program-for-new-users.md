Mega.nz is a free and paid cloud provider which offers several license models, one is a free one which in the past offered their users 50 GB free space. Seems MEGA changed his mind and switched this to an "<span class="ipsType_break ipsContained">Achievements" license model which means you can only get more space if you pay for it or if you invite others.
</span>

Last time I checked Mega this wasn't there:

<h2><span class="ipsType_break ipsContained">Achievements</span></h2>

The new "<span class="ipsType_break ipsContained">Achievements</span>" system is a bit strange but the following chart should explain how you still get your free space:

<pre title="Double click to select all"><code>+----------------------------+---------------+----------------+------------+
|        Achievements        | Storage space | Transfer quota | Expiration |
+----------------------------+---------------+----------------+------------+
|      Create an account     |      15GB     |        -       |    never   |
+----------------------------+---------------+----------------+------------+
| Account registration bonus |      35GB     |        -       |   30 days  |
+----------------------------+---------------+----------------+------------+
|      Install MEGAsync      |      20GB     |      40GB      |  180 days  |
+----------------------------+---------------+----------------+------------+
|   Install our mobile app   |      15GB     |      30GB      |  180 days  |
+----------------------------+---------------+----------------+------------+
|   Invite a friend to MEGA  |      10GB     |      20GB      |  365 days  |
+----------------------------+---------------+----------------+------------+</code></pre>

<h2>I have an old account, what am I affected too?</h2>

"<em>Achievement are only for new accounts, your original account will keep its 50GB, they won't be reduced to 15GB.</em>" This seems to only affect new accounts which are good news.

<h2>Final Words</h2>

Mega is still a solid cloud solution and their encryption system is not bad however, newer users might not like that there not getting the same space as the old users which I can understand. It's unclear why MEGA.nz did this silently without any official announcement.
