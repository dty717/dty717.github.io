Version v6 release adds a lot of new functions, like a new document encryption and an improvement Font Management.

<h4>Speed improvements</h4>

The new version is bloody fast it opens quick without wasting many resources compared to version 4 and 5. It’s as fast as MS Office now and the application resources are a little bit less now.

<h2>Android Version still a mess</h2>

Sadly the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.collabora.libreoffice" rel="noopener">Android version</a> is still behind, seems no one really cares about it and it seems it never gets out of its beta status – and this for a reason – it’s a crashing mess! OfficeSuite (paid solution) is still the number one on Android when it comes to PDF or every other document, it simply does a better job without that it crashes once.

I’m not sure about the iOS version but I think it has a similar issue.

<h4>Lack of features</h4>

Besides the crashes the LibreOffice version lacks features which not made me switch from OfficeSuite, it’s difficult to work with because it is not really optimized for touch or smaller screens and some important things are missing, so you can’t choose separate Fonts and the DPI scaling is just horrible.

There is also no Chromecast function so you can’t easily project your files onto your TV or PC Display which would be useful in case you want to show your presentation to others, so it ends up with copying the file to a PC/Mac manually – this sucks! It’s 2018 now guys!

<h2>Verdict</h2>

The new version is faster and adds a lot of useful functions, I like the functions and the new possibilities to encrypt the documents if you want.
