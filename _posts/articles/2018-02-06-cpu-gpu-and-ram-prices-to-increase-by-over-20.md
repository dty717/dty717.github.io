SUMCO is a Japanese based company and is responsible for more than 60% of the world’s silicon wafer supply. With a 20 percent price increase, CPU, GPU, DRAM and Flash makers may have taken their business elsewhere, but it looks like they won’t necessarily have that opportunity. <a href="https://www.kitguru.net/channel/generaltech/matthew-wilson/tech-is-reportedly-going-to-get-much-more-expensive-as-silicon-costs-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This week, GlobalWafers Chairwoman, Doris Hsu, informed shareholders that the company would raise prices for silicon wafers by 20 percent</a> this year. This is really a bad news because electronics getting more expensive for all of us.

<h2>Reason?</h2>

Apparently, the biggest reason for this price increase is a shortage in 12-inch, 300mm wafers, which are traditionally used to build processors, graphics chips and RAM. Given that GPU prices have already risen to ridiculous heights due to crypto-mining, this is an additional blow to DIY PC builders.

<h2>My Comment</h2>

The time has come to pray for the collapse of the crypto coins. I wish all the greedy people who stop us from upgrading video cards lose everything and get back to life they had before, where only gamers and graphic professionals bought such products!

I'm not against crypto-mining in general but we need to find better solution because at the end we the small people are paying for sch asshole miners because there getting more and more greedy!
