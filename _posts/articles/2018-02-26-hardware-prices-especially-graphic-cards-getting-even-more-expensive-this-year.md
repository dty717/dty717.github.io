The bad news here is that there is no end in sight.

<blockquote>There is a couple of reason why there is a shortage and also such a high demand of cards.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">First the shortage.</span>
All new cell phones coming out by Apple and Samsung (and others) last year started using the same memory as graphics cards. Apple and Samsung are willing to pay more for this memory to make sure they get it first and all of it that they need. This has created a shortage of memory for the much smaller companies like MSI, Gigabyte, Asus, and EVGA to make graphics cards.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Next the demand</span>
This is obvious as the mining craze that's been going on has created a huge demand in the market as miners are goblin up just about every card available on earth.

<strong>The pricing in the market will most likely continue to go up through Q3 of this year</strong> most likely before we start seeing any type of relief. So, unfortunately, the end to this is not right around the corner and we have not seen the worst of it yet.

The primary reason for all this is, as I say, crypto-mining, a craze so pervasive that <a href="https://www.chaingers.io/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even UNICEF are getting into it</a> which means the hype is real, not as real as in 2017 but it's still ongoing. However, a current worldwide shortage of fast RAM for graphics cards and systems alike is further compounding the problem. DDR4 sticks are also boasting inflated prices right now, and also with no apparent end in sight. It’s not anything like as hard to come by as GPUs are, but the prices are even further through the roof – the cheapest 8GB DDR4 stick I can find is around 65 to 70 bucks, whereas less than a year ago you could bag similar but faster RAM for 40$. Even the older DDR3 is not spared, and nor is the GDDR5 used by most well-specced new graphics cards.

<h2>GPU and RAM more and more expensive</h2>

The reason for the increase in RAM prices is similar to the reason it affects SSD prices — issues such as power outages affecting DRAM manufacturer Samsung have decreased RAM supply at the same time that demand continues to go up. Servers and mobile RAM are the primary drivers of the increased demand, particularly as Android smartphones continue to increase the amount of installed memory.

<h2>Best strategy is to wait</h2>

Wait and drink some coffee till it's over, everything ends and so the mining-hype. However, CPU's are right now cheap and you could by a CPU and motherboard now and wait till you have a chance to grab a cheaper GPU and RAM. There is no pressure which forces you to upgrade right now and better hardware is coming next year like Volta for an acceptable price for this class of graphics card.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Mining is a problem and it seems to affect all of us, GPU's (most of them) are designed to game, sadly some people abusing really everything to quickly make some money and we only have the hope that this will end soon and the bubble bursts to normalize the hardware prices again. On the other side, the manufacturers can be happy because they getting a lot of money because of the boom and I hope we see that they use the money to build better hardware or for research reasons which then would help all of us, so there are two sides of the medal.
