A power outage at Samsung destroys approximately 3.5% of Global NAND Flash output for March 2018 an this means that we can expect to see higher prices very soon.

<h2>What happened?</h2>

A power outage at a Samsung fab near Pyeongtaek region in South Korea is being <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/12535/power-outage-at-samsungs-fab-destroys-3-percent-of-global-nand-flash-output" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by AnandTech</a> - there saying tha the half hour power outage reportedly damaged 50,000 to 60,000 wafers of V-NAND memory, which represent around 11% of Samsung's monthly output and around 3.5% of the global NAND output. This alone is already bad news for Samsung but it gets worse for normal consumers like us and everything which depends on the NAND market, overall spoken this means we can expect higher prices until this outage is fully compensated.

<h2>Closing Words</h2>

I think the lesson Samsung learned here is to use an own and separated backup power system which kicks in when such things happening to avoid all this, as a result we're going to see around 10% prices for all NAND related products this year and no one exactly knows for how long.
