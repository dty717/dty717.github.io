LineageOS 15.1 (Android Oreo) brings a lot of new changes and some devices might getting the update while others don't this more because of driver changes rather than a software problem.

<b>Styles</b>
You can now style some aspects of your device by selecting a custom accent color and by choosing between a light or dark interface. A really cool feature we’ve added to this is the (optional) integration with LiveDisplay: during the day the device will have a light theme, and at night some of the interface elements will turn dark, so it’s easier on the eyes. What if this isn’t enough? What if you want your device style to match your wallpaper colors? Automatic will propose you the best colors combination based on your current wallpaper. While this is not a full theming replacement, we hope to satisfy users that requested simple theming capabilities.

<b>New Trebuchet launcher</b>
The homegrown launcher has been rewritten to make it more up to date with Android standards. Some redundant features have been removed and new ones, such as icon packs support, have been added. All our apps have received a new adaptive icon too, thanks for the feedback you provided in the Summer Survey (you can see a sneak peek of them above). Moreover, Trebuchet will allow you to choose the icon shape that suits your liking from the circle, superellipse, squircle, and teardrop.

<b>QR support in Snap camera</b>
There’s now a QR reader mode in our camera app, which supports QR-encoded URLs, plain text, SMS, email addresses, contacts cards, events, phone numbers and location coordinates.

<b>Enabling root access</b>
The way you enable root hasn't changed, it's still the same as described <a href="https://www.lineageosroms.org/forums/topic/how-to-root-lineage-os-13-14-1-marshmallow-nougat-rom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Basically, you have to download SuperSU, Magisk or Superuser packages and then you flash it which gives you the ability to unlock the function since LineageOS isn't pre-rooted.
