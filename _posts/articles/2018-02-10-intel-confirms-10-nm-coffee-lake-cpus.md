The secret is out, 10 nm CPU's are coming, well not really a secret but it got officially confirmed now which means as for now 4 new Coffe Lake CPU's on the way.

The new CPU's using a 2+0 architecture which means the DIE is the same but the integrated graphics unit is deactivated.

There from what I can see beta BIOS updates available to address the Meltdown and Spectre issue. The new architecture brings a more efficient chip and this is really pointless as for now because you need a dedicated graphics card which means such efficiency is then gone.

It's unclear when exactly the chips going to be released on the market.
