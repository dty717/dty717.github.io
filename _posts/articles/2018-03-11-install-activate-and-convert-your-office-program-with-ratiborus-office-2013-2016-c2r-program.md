<h2>Office 2013-2016 C2R Program Overview</h2>

The design of this utility is easy to understand, you can choose in the 'Main' tab what you like to install, if you like to install Office in a full setup, check everything but the program also gives you the opportunity to install only certain parts (single products) of the Office in case you only need eg. Word.

Office 2013-2016 C2R comes in two versions, a Lite one and a normal one, both are available as installer or portable version. The Lite version comes without the utility tab which means you only can install and configure Office.

As the name suggest the program works with all supported Office version from 2013 up to the latest Office 2019 package. The download links within the program are fetches from official MS servers.

<h2>Program usage</h2>

Here the basic steps to use this program:

<ul>
    <li>Uninstall Office 2016 via (Control panel) applet "Add or remove Programs" in case Office is already installed.</li>
    <li>Uninstall Office 2016 using the "Force Remove Office" and restart your computer. You can skip this part if you never had Office installed, this is only needed to remove leftovers.</li>
    <li>Install Office by clicking the "Install Office" button, in case you haven't Office, go to the "Download Office" Tab and select the version which you like to download.</li>
    <li>Go to "Utilities" tab and do the conversion "Office RETAIL =&gt; VL". (The step is optional)</li>
    <li>Then click "Activate Office" and click "Activate Office".</li>
</ul>

The Uninstall process is optional and only required if Office is already installed since the program needs to convert your version to a volume license in order to activate it.
