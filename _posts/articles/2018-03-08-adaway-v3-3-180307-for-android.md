AdAway is more or less alive, some members maintaining the code, perfectslayer - a member from XDA compiled the latest version for us version 3.3-180307 fixes a lot of problems and also adds chainfire's systemless root support together with Magisk 15.x support.

<h2>What's new in Version 3.3</h2>

The full changelog and official announcement is available <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=75785065&amp;postcount=10597" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. You don't have to uninstall v3.2 in case you want to upgrade because the APK was signed with the same keys (the ones from mrRobinson).

<ul>
    <li>Improve systemless activation error handling - by PerfectSlayer</li>
    <li>Improve su location detection - by tstaylor7</li>
    <li>Update Mongoose webserver - by MrRobinson</li>
    <li>Replace CyanogenMod references by LineageOS - by experience7</li>
    <li>Update translations - by Mattter, mission712, ThomasSmallert and muzena</li>
    <li>Fix translation attributes - by Vankog</li>
    <li>Fix Magisk 15.x support - by pec0ra</li>
</ul>

It's mostly a maintenance release only systemless root was improved and Magisk support were added and corrected. Ore support is planned for version 4.0 <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=75807945&amp;postcount=10631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the latest statements.</a> The current version does already works with Oreo (Android 8) but needs several more improvements to get into a more stable condition.

<h3>Why is F-Droid showing an older version?</h3>

<a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.adaway" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F-Droid still shows v3.2</a> because the new version was compiled by perfectslayer (XDA Forums member) with the correct signature and with given permission to publish it.

<h2>Download</h2>

The new version can be found on <a href="https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=890129502657588424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AndroidFileHost</a>. It was mentioned in the original announcement post that F-Droid get the new version in the coming days.

<h2>Alternative Ad blocker Apps</h2>

There many but when it comes to the pioneers and the ones which really offering something then there only three to mention.

<ul>
    <li>AFWall+ (Firewall but you also can block domains/IP's)</li>
    <li>NetGuard (Firewall but explicit also coded to block ads)</li>
    <li>AdGuard (Adblocker with advance functions, can also act like a Firewall with advance statistics)</li>
</ul>

I write about each of these Apps in the coming weeks, there all pretty unique and each app has its own benefits.

<h2>Final Words</h2>

AdAway was maybe the pioneer under the ad-blockers, sadly the source got long time not maintained and the project is still a mess. A GitHub source code including stable download mirrors directly from GitHub and an integrated update mechanism would help a lot but of course you shouldn't give up your hopes - everything is possible and since PerfectSlayer and other XDA members are working on the project again we might see some bigger changes very soon.

AdAway is still a useful Android application because it doesn't waste much resources and does the job, however HTTPS delivered ads can be a bit 'complicated' to block and AdAway is maybe not the best choice for this.
