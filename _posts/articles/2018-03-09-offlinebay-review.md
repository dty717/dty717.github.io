<a href="https://thepiratebay.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pirate Bay</a> has many names, Virus Bay, Download Bay, TPB and more but we all know it as the number one platform when it comes to torrents since it gets monitored by a lot of people it stays clean. The problem is that a lot of users and organizations want to bring this platform down once and for all, as a result the website is often offline due DOS attack reasons, blocking, maintenance or hacking reasons. Usually that's not a problem because there <a href="https://thepiratebay-proxylist.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mirror websites available</a>, but are they really trustworthy? I have my doubts and not only me - as a result the user <a href="https://pirates-forum.org/User-techtac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">techtac</a> created a solution for this which allows you to download torrents even after TPB went offline.

<h2>Overview</h2>

OfflineBay is a utility which basically reads a <a href="https://thepiratebay.org/static/dump/csv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database file</a> and allow you to search it so you're able to get the magnet link. Currently the database file which is around 100 MB big must be manually be downloaded but this process could be automatic done with future updates.

The program itself is basically a Java based utility which means you need Java 8 in order to use it, currently the program wasn't tested in Java 9 and it's reported that it's only working the the 8 version, so keep this in mind if you're going to use OfflineBay. The developed promised that it gets an update for this soon.

Since it's in Java, it will work on all operating systems and that's maybe the reason why the developer choosed to use this language.

A discussion about an Android app is also ongoing and it would be possible.

<h3>Closed Source</h3>

Sadly the program source code isn't available, first scans showed the <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/cc95c3074a58c643334aa68bbe165dfb9686950e07ab763d62d9212f2fd28b7c/details" target="_blank" rel="noopener">program is clean</a> but hopefully the developer decided to host it on GitHub or another platform to review the code and to help bringing this promising project forward.

<h2>Fake Website https://www.offlinebay.com</h2>

There is already someone which created <a href="https://www.offlinebay.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offlinebay.com</a> and the <a href="https://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Release-OfflineBay-1-0-2-Download-torrents-from-thePirateBay-offline?pid=219034#pid219034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original developer confirmed it wasn't him who created the page</a>.

<h2>About the App</h2>

Theoretically not only TPB could be supported, every other torrent platform which provides a dump file could be added which is really a great idea because sometimes torrent sites getting offline and a specific magnet link is maybe only available on that specific page.

<blockquote>Plan for OfflineBay was to go into blockchain. But there are major concerns. Mostly ethical concerns. As you may know TPB torrent database is well monitored and well moderated. That’s why it’s very clean thanks to all the mods. So my concern is that i don’t want to make this tool a Hotbed for all the Scammers and pedophiles all around the world. As in disturbing things you usually find in dark web. Confused That’s why this may not move onto blockchain or any other kind of P2P DB mechanism because then we lose the ability of moderation. Also then OB steps straight into the illegal zone with that step. I know it may be a huge improvement and there maybe workarounds. But i won’t be able to live with it if and when it comes to that. At the end, this tool was always meant to keep TPB alive on difficult times. It will always keep doing that. This doesn’t mean that there won’t be updates. Whatever facilities comes with the TPB dumps in the future, those will be integrated to OB</blockquote>

After you imported the dump file you see this black interface which allows you to get the magnet links and to search for a torrent. Clicking on the torrent opens you torrent application like uTorrent or BitTorrent.

Basic details are given, like Seeders/Peers but keep in mind that these aren't the real numbers these are the numbers at the time the dump file was created.

<h2>Is it worth to use?</h2>

After some days I can say yes, I like the idea because some provider blocking ThePirateBay domain or the DNS requests to this domain. It's quite unique utility so far but you need to be careful to avoid fake clients because there is no source code or official link except the <a href="https://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Release-OfflineBay-1-0-2-Download-torrents-from-thePirateBay-offline?pid=217191#pid217191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> post which points to a Mega folder., the problem with Mega is that there blocking the download link when there realize that there is a lot of traffic behind it so hosting this on other pages like GitHub would be better for everyone.

<h2>Final Words</h2>

OfflineBay is a unique utility which solves the offline question and hopefully we see more updates for it, there some opening questions like the source question, the dump file question - 100 MB is really big - and other questions asked by the community like if there will be mobile support or not.

Let's only hope this program not gets DMCA'd or someone bad steal the idea and release it under different name.

The program gets my full recommadation for those people which often working with torrents or the ones which are ISP blocked from the platform. All other people should prefer the Browser variant since a 100 MB database is in my opinion noth worth to be downloaded each time when you only need here and there a torrent.
