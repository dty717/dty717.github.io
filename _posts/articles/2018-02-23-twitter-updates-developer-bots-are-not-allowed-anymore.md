Really good news for us which are not big fans of spam, Twitter has <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2018/automation-and-the-use-of-multiple-accounts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released new developer rules</a> which disallowing Bots which means developer don't get access to their API to build such nasty programs - This prevents also that the bad guys creating multiple accounts and setting up their bots to spam access the social platform under different 'fake' accounts. Additionally, simultaneous Likes, Retweets, etc. cannot be performed by multiple accounts anymore.

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

As always in the world, there are exceptions, applications that broadcast or share weather, emergency, or other public service announcements of broad community interest for example earthquake warnings are permitted to post this content across multiple accounts who have authorized an app, this process is manually approved by Twitter.

In case someone breaks the rule his accounts get a permanent ban, so if you found something which is still spreading the spam use the 'report' button and help to get rid of those annoying spam tweets.

<h2>Final Words</h2>

It was about time! Less Spam and annoying bot tweets are always something which destroys the fun on social media platforms. Hopefully, we see more privacy-related rules from Twitter side soon, because we should not only forget that there are bad guys out there, the platforms itself are also often under suspicion to monitor just everything even if you're not anymore on their pages, this also must be stopped in my opinion once and for all.
