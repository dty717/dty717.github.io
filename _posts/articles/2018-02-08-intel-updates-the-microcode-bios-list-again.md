Intel updated yesterday his microcode list to address an issue to resolve the known reboot problem.

<h2>Skylake only</h2>

The updated microcodes are (for now) only for Skylake systems (Desktop's/Notebook's) and it's unclear if other (older) systems are following or not. The situation right now is really messed up because it takes a lot of time to merge such changes for OEM and to rollout these to the customers and yet again we get new BIOS updates.

<h2>Quantity over Quality</h2>

Because everyone was crying at Intel we got half-cooked solutions. Which means it could be possible that we get another update this year if there are other issues reported by customers.
