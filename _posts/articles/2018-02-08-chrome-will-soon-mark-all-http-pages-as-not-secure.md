Google <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has announced</a> today that with the release of Chrome 68 in July, Chrome will mark all HTTP websites as "not secure." This change is in line with what Google has been trying to do for past several years, and pushing that sites adopt the HTTPS encryption.

For now, you still can use <a href="//flags/#enable-mark-http-as" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#enable-mark-http-as</a> to control this behavior but this option will disappear.

Chrome's new interface will help users understand that all HTTP sites are <em>not secure</em> and continue to move the web towards a secure HTTPS web by default. HTTPS is easier and cheaper than ever before due Let's Encrypt &amp; Co. and it unlocks both performance improvements and powerful new features that are too sensitive for HTTP.

The change will arrive in July this year with the final release of Chrome 68.
