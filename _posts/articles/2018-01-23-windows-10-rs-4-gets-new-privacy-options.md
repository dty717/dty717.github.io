The next major update for Windows 10 is in the pipeline and the good news is that we getting more control over the telemetry data. The latest Insider Preview builds suggest that new tools to manage this data are in the works.

The clues are hidden in plain sight in the latest Windows 10 preview builds. Builds 17063 and 17074 - <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">account.microsoft.com/privacy/</a> doesn't mention the changes yet but I expect they will do it one or two weeks before we getting the final build. Microsoft also agreed with European privacy agencies last year to implement measures that would <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/french-authorities-close-windows-10-privacy-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop collecting excessive data and tracking browsing by users without their consent</a>. It's possible that some of the forthcoming changes are tied to the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that takes full effect later this year. In current releases of Windows 10, the Feedback &amp; diagnostics section is buried at the bottom of a long list. In the latest Insider preview builds, that category's name changes to Diagnostics &amp; feedback, and it moves to a much more prominent position at the top of the list.

We will see what Microsoft will change with the coming builds.
