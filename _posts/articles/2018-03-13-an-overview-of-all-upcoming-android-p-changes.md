AT this time once again an incredible thanks to the community and XDA for finding all the candy in Android P!

<h2>Notch is coming</h2>

Android P headline feature is basically spoken support for the display cutout which is a Google reactions to Apples notch. Lot's of folks are going to complain about this I already can predict this without any crystal ball

Starting with the developer preview Google has made it possible to simulate all the different flavors of notch to see how the app deals with different kinds of cutout.

<h2>Android P a good one?</h2>

I think yes, the security and app related changes are nice to have and a big step forward for the mass in a better smartphone OS. The user interface changes, Material Design 2.0 are something which I say are a matter of taste. Personally I like Google's Material Design but not everyone likes it 'flat'. I think there are a lot of guides upcoming how you can convert your Android to an cheaper iPhoneX because of the notch changes, I'll say no and skip the hype because iOS is definitely not so my flavor.

I like to say that P will be a good release because most of the changes make sense to me and I often watch the community around Android so I can - based on the reactions - mostly see if people going to do the change or not and I do believe that people will make the switch very fast (well, depending if the OEM rolls out an update for you or not).

Let's only hope that the new features are not going to hurt the battery or breaking a lot of apps, that's the main problem, it often takes a half year until the apps you daily use are compatible for the new features.
