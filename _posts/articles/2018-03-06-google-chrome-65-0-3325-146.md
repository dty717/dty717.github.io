Google just updated their <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrome browser to version</a> 65.0.3325.146 and there isn't any changelog yet available on the official announcement Blog. But this will be the first stable v65 build after several Beta builds. According to the source file there is also another build 65.0.3325.147 but I haven't found an official compiled download link for it so I assume this build isn't ready yet.

The stable release for all platforms will be rolled out over the next view days. This is a normal procedure and the official Blog will also get an update, usually it takes a while to get a post which list all the new changes and the updated download links.

<h2>Download</h2>

As of writing this post Google hasn't rolled out the stable version for all platforms, so I only can provide these two links right now which are for Windows 32-/64-Bit.

<h2>Final Words</h2>

The changes which Chrome v65 offers are interesting and the browser constantly gets better and better. The integrated ads-blocker mechanism is right now unique and I haven't found something to criticize about this because my fear was that Google manipulate or hardcoded some of their own services to whitelist them but that's not happening. The exclusions which break pages are the same like within the original EasyList file so there is no difference.

The HTTP insecure indicator is now more or less a new default for all Browsers and a good step forward to warn unexpired users that HTTP content is less secure (overall spoken) compared to HTTPS.

Chrome becomes less spying than Firefox which is one of the main argument why I prefer Chrome right now, don't get me wrong if Internet Explorer would be more secure or fit to my needs I even would switch to it immediately but Chrome is often outstanding because Google is dictating how the Internet should look like, people often criticize this because this (according to them) gives Google full control over the web which is not really true since the changes they made especially the HTTPS push and more helped all of us not even Google so I like to see their changes a little bit more objective than others. On the other side every product which you use wants to collect data to improve their products and that is a huge other point which I complain about since years because you simply can't opt-out not even with an ads-blocker because some information are always collected but this is quite common for every page these days.

Chrome v65 is a step forwards in the right direction, what Firefox calls 'Fingerprint' protection is already native integrated since a quite long time but needs to be activated with about:flags changes but the risk is always there (same like in Firefox) that you might break some websites or their functions which seems to be the main argument why there not enabled by default. Chrome v65 also adds several about:flags which are highly experimental and the reason I won't mention them until there stable enough to deserve an explicit mention from me.
