The BUILD Conference this year is from 7. - 9. May and it will show Windows Redstone 4 (Spring Creators Update) among several other announcements, as always you can see the livestream or the recap on my YouTube Channel.

<h2>What's the focus this year?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Mixed Reality</li>
    <li>Windows 10 / S and the UWP future</li>
    <li>AI</li>
    <li>Possible some short previews of the upcoming Redstone 5 Build (<em>rumors</em>)</li>
</ul>

The funniest thing about this news is that Google uses the same date for their conference, I'm not sure if that was planned or coincidence.

I'm pretty sure I get my hands on the specific topics one week before the build conference starts (as every year) which means I will provide you with more details before the BUILD starts.

Stay tuned for more!
