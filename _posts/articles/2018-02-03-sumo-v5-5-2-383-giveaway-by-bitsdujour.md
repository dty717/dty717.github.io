It's weekend and I'll drop some candy for you ladies and gentlemen, I just found that <a href="http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/sumo/in=todays-deals-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitsdujour.com has a new Giveaway</a>, SUMo. <a href="https://www.kcsoftwares.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SUMo</a> is similar like Secunia PSI a little product which scans your PC for installed/portable software and then it shows you if there is an update or not. Unless other products you can use it portable and it's really fast, you can customize the scanning by excluding specific folders or allow even the scanning for beta software, personally I used it once a day because it's really useful.

The giveaway works with the normal <a href="https://www.kcsoftwares.com/?sumo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SUMo Lite setup</a> or their own <a href="http://download.bitsdujour.com/bdj/downloads/2018/sumo_lite-January2018.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giveaway installer version</a>. From what I see upgrades aren't included in the license but that should not be a big problem because there very often giveaways all over the internet.

The product is really nice because you quickly see if there is an update or not, PSI never really worked for me because it was slow and bugged so when SUMo got released years ago I switched to it and I totally recommend it.

Okay enough talk here is the key:
