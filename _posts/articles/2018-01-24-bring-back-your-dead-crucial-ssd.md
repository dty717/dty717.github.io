Maybe you're aware of it maybe not, but Crucial SSDs have a mechanism to "self-repair" themeselves which means if your SSD just broke out of nowhere you have a good chance to give them a second life! Of course this will not work if the hardware itself got physically damaged.

This guide doesn't replaces a professional data recovery laboratory, which would be a more serious way but you can try the method below before you sendit away - which might costs a lot of money.

<h2>Power cycle your SSD</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Only connect the SATA power connection and not the data cable! A USB enclosure with an external power source will also work!</li>
    <li>Once you have the drive connected, simply power on the computer and wait. The computer will need to stay powered on for 20-30 min and it is recommended that you don't use the computer during this process.</li>
    <li>Power the computer down and disconnect the drive for ~30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Repeat steps min. 2 or more times, some people say they tried it 6 times till it worked so don't give up!</li>
    <li>Reconnect the drive normally and boot the computer.</li>
</ul>

There is no gurantee but you have nothing to lose at this point - you only can win something, so go ahead and try it yourself. I have tested it with an old Sandisk drive and it didn't worked, a friend tried it with an older Crucial and he reported it worked.

Let me know if you could gave your old SSD a second life.
