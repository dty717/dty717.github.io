March seems to have a Mixed Reality problem, so Microsoft released a optional Hotfix which isn't available via WUS or the update catalog. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4094047/you-are-unable-to-launch-or-install-windows-mixed-reality-after-instal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KB4094047</a> fixes the problem when you see a error message when you try to install or start the Mixed Reality application in Windows 10 Build 1709.

    <li>X86 systems aren't affected</li>
</ul>

The system needs a reboot after you installed the update, in case you see the '<em>The update is not applicable to your computer.</em>' error then this means you haven't installed KB4090913 (OS: 16299.251) before or you not use Microsoft's Mixed Reality.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Another hidden update which is so called hotfix, but why always hide the good stuff from people which really need it? Still the part which I don't get, deliver it via WUS for those people which needs it, or don't release it at all, period. People need to read articles or running into malware problems because there trying to patch their systems with unofficial tools, that's the opposite what MS wants and it's a waste of time for user which trying to stay up2date.

It's also strange that the official link description to the KB4090913 points to the http download instead of https - maybe just a typo?! Dunno, but in my opinion they should't provide the option to download something over http anymore at all. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3470" src="https://chefkochblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/thumbdown.gif" alt="thumbdown" width="29" height="20" />

However, thanks that there is a hotfix for those who are affected by this but Microsoft might need to re-think about the words I said here to improve their offers and update mechanism.
