Hi, I'm dty717.

I’m a private independent freelancer from Russia/Germany who is interested in all things of technology. I’m getting excited about technology and I like to tweak, test and review all software and hardware which I come across on my daily Internet journey. 

I worked several years for Microsoft (networking) and NVIDIA (CUDA) and have a lot of Internet & coding related experience earned over the years. 

I try to help random people whenever I can and I like to share my knowledge with others.
