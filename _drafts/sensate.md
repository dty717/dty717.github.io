# sleepy sensate 

so tired and anxious, so sleepless and <br />
still.<br />
<blockquote>my pillows no longer retain<br />
the faintest smell</blockquote>
of <br />
<blockquote>my love,</blockquote>
whose beautiful face <br />
once sleptâ€” <br />

> mere inches<br />

from my lips, nose, eyes, ears,  and <br />
fingers. <br />
<br />
when next her head <br />
lies sweetly next <br />
to mine, i will <br />
*sing her a song*<br />
and <br />
*kiss her lips*<br />
and *stroke*<br />
*her hair* and *smell* <br />
*her neck*, <br />
and *hear the sounds* <br />
*she makes* <br /><br />

***when our skin***<br />
***no longer***<br />
has<br />
***anything*** <br />
***between us.***<br />
